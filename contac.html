    <title>Amitabh Bachchan</title>
    <meta name="description"
        content="Amitabh Bachchan (born October 11, 1942, Allahabad, India) Indian film actor, perhaps the most popular star in the history of India’s cinema, known primarily for his roles in action films.">

        content="Bachchan, the son of the renowned Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, attended Sherwood College in Nainital and the University of Delhi. He worked as a business executive in Calcutta (Kolkata) and performed in theatre before embarking on a film career. Bachchan made his big-screen debut in Saat Hindustani (1969; “Seven Indians”), and he received the first of his numerous Filmfare Awards for his performance in Anand (1971). His first major success came with Zanjeer (1973; “Chain”). A string of action films followed, including Deewar (1975; “Wall”), Sholay (1975; “Embers”), and Don (1978). Nicknamed “Big B,” Bachchan personified a new type of action star in Indian films, that of the “angry young man,” rather than the romantic hero. He was often compared to Clint Eastwood—although, unlike Eastwood and other American action stars, Bachchan was renowned for his versatility, and many of his roles showcased his talents at singing, dancing, and comedy.">
