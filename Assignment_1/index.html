        content="Amitabh Bachchan (born October 11, 1942, Allahabad, India) Indian film actor, perhaps the most popular star in the history of India’s cinema, known primarily for his roles in action films.">

        content="Bachchan, the son of the renowned Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, attended Sherwood College in Nainital and the University of Delhi. He worked as a business executive in Calcutta (Kolkata) and performed in theatre before embarking on a film career. Bachchan made his big-screen debut in Saat Hindustani (1969; “Seven Indians”), and he received the first of his numerous Filmfare Awards for his performance in Anand (1971). His first major success came with Zanjeer (1973; “Chain”). A string of action films followed, including Deewar (1975; “Wall”), Sholay (1975; “Embers”), and Don (1978). Nicknamed “Big B,” Bachchan personified a new type of action star in Indian films, that of the “angry young man,” rather than the romantic hero. He was often compared to Clint Eastwood—although, unlike Eastwood and other American action stars, Bachchan was renowned for his versatility, and many of his roles showcased his talents at singing, dancing, and comedy.">

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <blockquote id="bio" cite="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Amitabh-Bachchan">
                <p>Bachchan returned to film and won a National Film Award for his portrayal of a mafia don in Agneepath
                    (1990; “Path of Fire”). He later headed Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd., an entertainment venture
                    that specialized in film production and event management. The business was plagued by financial
                    difficulties, however, and Bachchan eventually returned to performing. His later movies included the
                    crime drama Hum (1991); Mohabbatein (2000; Love Stories), a musical that was a major box-office
                    success; and Black (2005), which was inspired by Helen Keller’s life story. For the latter film
                    Bachchan won another National Film Award, and he also received that honour for his performance in
                    the drama Paa (2009), playing a boy who suffers from an aging disease similar to progeria.

                    By the early 21st century, Bachchan had appeared in more than 175 Bollywood films, and at age 70 he
                    made his Hollywood debut as a minor character in Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby (2013). His later
                    notable films included the comedy Piku (2015), for which he won his fourth National Film Award, and
                    Pink (2016), a crime drama in which he was cast as a lawyer. In 102 Not Out (2018), he played a man
                    trying to break the record for the oldest man alive. The crime drama Badla (2019) was among the
                    biggest hits of Bachchan’s career.

                    In addition, from 2000 to 2006 Bachchan hosted the television game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, the
                    Indian version of the American and British hit Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? His easygoing nature
                    and charisma helped make the show one of India’s top television programs.</p>
